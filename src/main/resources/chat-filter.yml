# Built in variables for chat-filter:
# msg - The message being sent to or received from the player
# player - The player object. Use as you would in java but with python syntax.

outgoing-chat:
  example: # Average Hawk flag message is:   HAWK: Username failed check. VL: 0
    pre-exec: '' # Encase you want to do anything before.
    check: 'msg.startswith("HAWK:") and ("VL:" in msg) and not (player.getName() in msg)'
    #We want that  not  to invert it because we want to cancel it if it is not their flag
    cancel: true # Cancel it; not their flag.
    # execute-commands: []

  example2: # Average Hawk notif message is:   HAWK: Username failed check. VL: 0
    pre-exec: ''
    check: 'msg.startswith("HAWK:") and "VL:" in msg and player.getName() in msg'
    #We want that  not  to invert it because we want to cancel it if its not their flag
    cancel: false # Don't cancel; it is their flag.
    replacement: '"&cOwO:&7 " + player.getName() + " failed: " + msg[msg.find(" failed ") + 8:msg.find(".")] + " with VL: "
    + msg[msg.find("VL:") + 4:] + "&a %player_x% %player_y% %player_z%"'
    is-json: false # The replacement is not json.
    # execute-commands: []

# Additional variables for incoming-chat and incoming-tab:
# label - The label of the command (with the `/` included)
#
# It's also going through a preprocessor that does an arg placeholder replacement.
# For ex: Let's say the chat is  /w Brandon Hello. How are you?
#
# %0% is replaced with     Brandon
# %1% is replaced with     Hello.
# %0-1% is replaced with   Brandon Hello.
# %1+% is replaced with    Hello. How are you?
# %6% is replaced with nothing since there's nothing at that arg
# %3-7% is replaced with   are you?
# %2+% is replaced with    How are you?
#
# These are replaced both in strings and as variables.
# This is a preprocessor that happens before python code is executed. Don't ask me why I kept it.
incoming-command:
  example:
    pre-exec: ''
    check: '((label.lower() == "/pl") or (msg.lower() == "/ver ") or (msg.lower() == "/version ")) and
    not player.hasPermission("spygotutils.filter.plugins")'
    cancel: true
    # No evaluator, but still going through PAPI and the preprocessor. (papi first tho)
    send-msg: '%prefix% &cDon''t get our plugins; thx. Command: %msg% Label: %label%'
    execute-commands:
      - 'sendmsg %player_name% %prefix% &cPlease don''t get our plugins.'

# Same rules as incoming-command apply here.
incoming-chat:
  example:
    pre-exec: ''
    check: 'not (label.startswith("/"))'
    cancel: false
    # PAPI and coloring are not done after the executor is finished.
    replacement: 'msg.replace(player.getName(), color("&6&l" + player.getName() + "&r"))'
    # execute-commands: []

# For the arg
incoming-tab:
  example:
    pre-exec: ''
    check: '(label.lower() == "/") or (label.lower() == "/ver") or (label.lower() == "/version")'
    cancel: false
    # List of stuff. PAPI and colored
    replacement:
      - 'lol'
      - 'no'
